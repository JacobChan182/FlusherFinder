                    <p>
                        FlushFinder was born from a simple yet profound need: to help people with IBS, Crohn's disease, 
                        ulcerative colitis, and other digestive conditions feel safe and prepared when leaving their homes. 
                        We believe that everyone deserves the freedom to explore, travel, and live life to the fullest, 
                        regardless of their health conditions.

                    <p>
                        For millions of people worldwide, digestive conditions create invisible barriers to daily life. 
                        The constant worry about finding a clean, accessible restroom can turn simple activities like 
                        grocery shopping, commuting, or dining out into sources of anxiety and stress. Many people 
                        with these conditions limit their activities or avoid leaving home altogether, missing out on 
                        life's experiences.
